# Git Workflow

To ensure high visibility and persistence of project progress:

1. **Commit Frequency**: Create a git commit immediately after completing every task in the `WORK_PLAN.md`.
2. **Push Consistency**: Push every commit to the remote repository (`main` branch) immediately.
3. **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive, conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: Add cannon system`, `fix: Correct ship rotation`).
4. **Clean State**: Ensure the project is in a compiling state (`cargo check` passes) before every commit.
