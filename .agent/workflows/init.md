description: Things to do to get started on a task
---

Please begin by gathering context about the project by reading the readme at README.md and reading the most recent git commits, and recent work logs at WORK_LOG.md to get a sense for  what's been worked on recently.

Then, ask the user what their task is.

Then, systematically research and plan how best to implement this task harmoniously with the codebase practices, minimizing the amount of tech debt added. Don't prematurely optimize, and use Bevy/ECS best practices.
